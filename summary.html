<h1>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe</h1>

<p>The adventure starts when Lucy goes into a wardrobe. She finds that she has been transported into a new world. She finds that it is a world bathed in winter. There she meets a faun named Mr. Tumnus. Later, she finds out that the faun is working for an evil witch, but he lets Lucy go. When she returns home, she is surprised to find that her siblings have not been looking for her. Edmund starts making fun of her imaginary land, only to find that it is real. They all find out that the witch has caught the faun with an accusation of treason. They soon find the beaver family, who brings them to meet Aslan, who is the Lord of Narnia. But Edmund ran away because he was deceived into thinking that the witch was kind. Once he is taken captive by the witch he realizes that he was mistaken. He later ends up being rescued by Aslan and his rescue party. 
 </p>

 <p>Edmund is soon reunited with his siblings. But the witch soon calls a meeting with Aslan. During that meeting, the witch reminds him that according to the rules of Narnia, every traitor by right is hers. Aslan responds by offering himself as a sacrifice in place of Edmund. During the evening, Susan and Lucy secretly go off to follow Aslan to the stone table. They are horrified with what they see is happening. The witch and her followers mock Aslan, and then soon after, they kill him. Susan and Lucy leave with a feeling that all hope is lost. But then they hear a deafening sound. When they return, they find that the stone table is cracked and there is no trace of Aslan's body. They become concerned that the witch has done something to Aslan's body. However, to their surpise and joy, Aslan appears. He explains to them that there is a deeper magic that states that a sacrifce of an innocent person would undo the witch's dark magic. Once they are reassured that Aslan is not a ghost, they ride with him to the witch's castle. Once Aslan breathes on the creatures that the witch had turned to stone, they become living again and join Aslan's army.
</p>

<p>Peter and his forces are in the middle of an intense battle with the witch and her army. Aslan and his army join the battle that is taking place and this turns the tide. Seeing Aslan fortifies Peter's army with courage while striking fear into the witch's forces.  Aslan defeats the witch in battle. Upon seeing that the witch is defeated, her army scatters and Peter's army is victorious. </p>

<p>Narnia breaks into celebration. The Pevensies are crowned Kings and Queens and rule over Narnia. Many years later, they go off looking for the white stag, because if caught, the stag could grant them wishes. But the stag leads them to the lamp post that they had seen when they first entered Narnia. As they continue journeying toward the lamp post, they find themselves going back through the wardrobe. They come out of the wardrobe and find that no time has passed despite having spent many years in Narnia. </p>
